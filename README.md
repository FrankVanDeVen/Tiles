# Tiles

Tiles is a game where the goal is to place tiles on the playing field in such a way that they touch each other and form a fully filled column from left to right or from top to bottom. If such a column is completely filled, it disappears from the playing field.

At the beginning of the game you get 3 tiles to choose from. If you press A, the selected tile moves to the playing field and you can place it in the desired place. You can do this by pressing A again. If a tile does not fit and is on top of a tile that has already been placed on the playing field, the tile will be placed back in the storage bin. If you have cleared all 3 tiles, you get 3 new tiles.
If you are unable to place all tiles from the storage bin, you can press B. You will then receive 3 new tiles. If you press B for the fourth time, the game ends. 

The game gets harder as your score gets higher Above 200, 350 and 500 points you get tiles that are more difficult to place.

Have fun with Tiles.
